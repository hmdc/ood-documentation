The initializers used to modify the navigation bar and the class
``NavConfig`` are deprecated in version 3.0 and will be removed in version 4.0.
The 3.x series will continue to support this, but sites should use the
``nav_categories`` property instead.

See :ref:`limit-auto-generated-menu-bars` and the
:ref:`nav_categories configuration property <nav_categories>` for more details.
