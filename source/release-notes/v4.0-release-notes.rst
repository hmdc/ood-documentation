Breaking Changes
----------------

Autoloading During Initialization Has Been Removed.
...................................................

.. include:: autoload.inc

NavConfig Has Been Removed.
...........................

.. include:: navconfig.inc

Configurations whitelist and blacklist Have Been Removed.
.........................................................

.. include:: allowlist.inc

Announcements Are Dismissible by Default.
.........................................

In version 4.0, :ref:`configure_announcements` now have the ability to be ``dismissible``.
Meaning users can press ``OK`` on the announcement and it will no longer appear
on the pages.

In prior versions of Open OnDemand, there was no way to dismiss or get rid of announcements.
Now in version 4.0, not only is there a way to dismiss announcements, announcements
themselves are ``dismissible`` by default.

The documentation for :ref:`configure_announcements` has been updated with this new feature.

Batch Connect Form Identifiers Are Now Lowercase.
.................................................

To resolve bugs with :ref:`dynamic-bc-apps`, batch connect form
items will now force lowercase HTML IDs.  This may break some JavaScript
at centers expecting the HTML ID of the form item to be a mix of uppercase
and lowercase.

Below is an example of defining a form item with uppercase keys like ``My_Cool_Form_Item``.

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---
  form:
    My_Cool_Form_Item

In this example, ``My_Cool_Form_Item`` has uppercase characters, but the HTML
ID of the form item will be lowercase, as shown below.

.. code-block:: html

  id="batch_connect_session_context_my_cool_form_item"

Root-Owned Configuration Files
..............................

In an effort to increase the security of the Open OnDemand platform,
the system will now start to only respond to root-owned configuration
files.

This means that all configuration files in ``/etc/ood/config``
will need to be owned by the ``root`` user (uid 0) in order to be used.

While these files need to be root-owned, they can continue to have any
group ownership.

Deprecations
------------

POLL_DELAY is Deprecated.
.........................

``POLL_DELAY`` is deprecated in 4.0 and being replaced
by documented configurations. See `Batch connect sessions poll delay`_
for more details.

Dependency Updates
------------------

This release updates the following dependencies:

- Passenger 6.0.23
- NGINX 1.26.1
- ondemand-dex 2.41.1

- Ruby 3.3 **(RHEL 8 & 9 only)**

  .. warning::

    The change in Ruby version means any Ruby-based apps that are not
    provided by the OnDemand RPM must be rebuilt or supply their own
    :ref:`ruby_starter_app_wrapper` to use the older version of Ruby.

- NodeJS 20 **(Every OS)**

  .. warning::

    The change in NodeJs version means any Node-based apps that are not
    provided by the OnDemand RPM must be rebuilt or supply their own
    :ref:`nodejs_starter_app_wrapper` to use the older version of NodeJs.

  .. warning:: Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 12 are no longer supported on ppc64le due to NodeJS 20 not being available on that architecture.


.. warning:: OnDemand repos no longer provide ``mod_auth_openidc`` or ``cjose``.

SELinux Changes
---------------

No SELinux chagnes in version 4.0.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------

Required Announcements
......................

:ref:`configure_announcements` have been updated in version 4.0 as seen in `Announcements Are Dismissible by Default.`_
breaking change above.

Along with that breaking change, there is also a very exciting feature you now use:
*required* announcements.

*Required* annoucements must be accepted before any page can be loaded. This is useful
to present users with a Terms of Service (TOS) or End User License Agreement (EULA)
or similar.  The users will not be able to do anything with Open OnDemand until they've
accepted this annoucments.

Global Batch Connect Items
..........................

In version 4.0, you can now define batch connect form items
in ondemand.d files to be used across any batch connect
application.

See :ref:`global_bc_form_items` for more details.

noVNC Quality and Compression Defaults
......................................

Sites can now set the default compression and quality values
for noVNC batch connect applications using the two ``ondemand.d``
properties :ref:`novnc_default_compression <novnc_default_compression>`
and :ref:`novnc_default_quality <novnc_default_quality>`.

Prior versions of Open OnDemand had these default values hard coded.
Now sites can set these defaults if they wish to provide their users
with higher quality defaults, for example.

Batch Connect Sessions Poll Delay
.................................

When a user lands on ``My Interactive Sessions`` page,
the client browser will request updates
every 10 seconds by default.

Sites that wish to change this behavior must use the hidden environment
variable ``POLL_DELAY``.

In version 4.0, this setting is now a documented configuration, with the
hidden environment variable ``POLL_DELAY`` being deprecated.
See :ref:`the bc_sessions_poll_delay documentation <bc_sessions_poll_delay>`
for more details.

System Status Application
.........................

Your center may have deployed the `OSC System Status Application`_.

Version 4.0 now includes this application natively, though it
currently supports only Slurm clusters.

Here's an example image from OSC detailing the system status of
our clusters.

.. figure:: /images/system-status.png
    :alt: An image showing the system status application with four panels, each for a different cluster. Each panel displays the number of available nodes, cores, GPUs, running jobs and queued jobs. It also shows the available percentages for nodes, cores, and GPUs.

This application will poll for updates at regular intervals to automatically
update the page. The default polling interval is 10 seconds. See :ref:`the documentation on status_poll_delay <status_poll_delay>` for more details.

Visit :ref:`disabling_applications` to disable this application.

data-hide Directives Now Respond to False.
..........................................

``data-hide`` directives now respond to both ``true`` to hide
the form item or ``false`` to show the form item.

Responding to ``false`` is new feature in version 4.0.

This was added as a convenience for some forms 

New data-label Directive
........................

Version 4.0 adds the ``data-label`` directive.  This is used to update
the help text on a given form when certain choices are made. An example of
may be a ``node_type`` select widget that can change it's help text based
on which node type the user has selected.

:ref:`dynamic-bc-apps-data-label` is the complete documentation for this
feature.

User Mapping Now Accepts User Identifiers.
..........................................

User mapping scripts can now return a UID instead of a username.
This is particularly useful for centers that have multiple domains where
username collisions may occur.

For example if the two users ``annie.oakley@osc.edu`` and ``annie.oakley@caltech.edu``
both *incorrectly* map to the user ``annie.oakley``, you will now be able to return
the unique number that is their UID (User Identifier) and therefore have
no collisions.


Interactive Apps Can Have a Text Header.
........................................

The ``form_header`` item can be added to interactive applications
to display additional text within the form. Note this is different from
the ``description`` field in the ``manifest.yml``, as the ``form_header`` text will not appear
on hover.

See the :ref:`form documentation for form_header <bc_form_header>`
for more details.

Removed Runtime Dependency on Software Collections
..................................................

OnDemand no longer requires Software Collections (SCL) on RHEL-based systems. 
OnDemand also no longer has an indirect dependency on the TCL environment module packages.
This removal of the SCL dependency should make it possible to install OnDemand on hosts such
as head nodes, where the Lmod environment modules are set up.

XDMoD Efficiency Widget Update
..............................

XDMoD job details widget now displays job efficiency calculations
for CPU usage, memory usage and elapsed time.

Prior versions of Open OnDemand only showed efficiency calculations
for CPU.

Edit and Delete Interactive Application Saved Settings
......................................................

Saved settings for interactive applications, introduced in version 3.1,
have been enhanced in version 4.0 to support editing and deletion.
This update allows users to manage their saved settings more effectively,
addressing a limitation in previous versions where settings could only be
created but not modified or removed.

See :ref:`edit-save-interactive-app-saved-settings` for more
details.

nginx_clean Now Cleans PUNs for Disabled Users.
...............................................

The helper method ``nginx_clean`` in the ``nginx_stage``
library will now remove PUNs and associated files for users
who have been disabled.

Disabled users are those who have been removed from LDAP and are no longer
valid users on that system.

This change ensures that centers that delete users (by removing them from LDAP)
will also clean up related processes on the OnDemand machine.

File Editor Interface Update
.............................

The file editor interface has been updated to align with
the overall OnDemand design. The navigation bar, now consistent
with other OnDemand pages, replaces the previous layout. Options
such as "Font Size" and Theme" have been relocated to the left
sidebar for improved accessibility.

The figure below is an image of how the file editor appears in 4.0.

.. figure:: /images/4.0_file_editor.png
   :alt: An image showing the file editor as it appears in 4.0 with the Open OnDemand navigation bar and a new panel to the left for saving and other file editor specific options.

Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

.. warning::

   **Update** the **development** or **test** instances of OnDemand installed at your center **first** before you modify the *production* instance.

.. warning::

  We have tested the upgrade from 3.1.10 to 4.0.0 at OSC's OnDemand instance.
